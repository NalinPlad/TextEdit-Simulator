Hello! üëã

This is a recreation of TextEdit, the default text editor of MacOS. If you use MacOS, you can open TextEdit right now to compare. It probably won't be 100% accurate, but I think its pretty close.

GITHUB: https://github.com/NalinPlad/TextEdit-Simulator

FEATURES ‚ú®
  - Auto saves text(try editing this text and reloading!)
  - Draggable window(position also autosaved)
  - File downloading(click "edited" in the top bar)

BUILT WITH üõ†Ô∏è
  - Vanilla HTML, JS, CSS
  - Vite
  - Wallpaper from 512pixels.net [1]
  - Vim(yes)

SOME COOL THINGS üòé
  - Downloading is done by generating a text file on the fly using blobs [2]
  - Window movement is done by editing margin values when dragging
  - This was made by @NalinPlad on Github [3]

If you are a web developer, I suggest trying to do something like this. Find a small application or tool and try to recreate it. It is a good exercise and its satisfying when you get it right!
