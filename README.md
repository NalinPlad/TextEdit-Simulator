###### A faithful recreation of MacOS TextEdit üìÑ

Hello! üëã Go check out the project [here](https://nalinplad.github.io/TextEdit-Simulator/) if you havent already

This is a recreation of TextEdit, the default text editor of MacOS. If you use MacOS, you can open TextEdit right now to compare. It probably won't be 100% accurate, but I think its pretty close.

#### FEATURES ‚ú®
  - Auto saves text(try editing this text and reloading!)
  - Draggable window(position also autosaved)
  - File downloading(click "edited" in the top bar)

#### BUILT WITH üõ†Ô∏è
  - Vanilla HTML, JS, CSS
  - Vite
  - Wallpaper from 512pixels.net [[1]](https://512pixels.net/downloads/macos-wallpapers-thumbs/)
  - Vim(yes)

#### SOME COOL THINGS üòé
  - Downloading is done by generating a text file on the fly using blobs [[2]](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19328891)
  - Window movement is done by editing margin values when dragging

If you are a web developer, I suggest trying to do something like this. Find a small application or tool and try to recreate it. It is a good exercise and its satisfying when you get it right!
